# Cloudflare x Toolhouse AI Hackathon 11/12

Welcome to Cloudflare and Toolhouse AI's hackathon!

Wifi: `Cloudflare Guest`

Password: `#savetheinternet`

The focus of this hackathon is building AI apps. It can be with Cloudflare, Toolhouse, or any other AI provider.

We know this is a relatively short time to hack, and your demos don't need to be polished. 

## Schedule

```
5:45 PM - Doors open & snacks
6:00 PM - Lightning talks
6:15 PM - Start hacking
8:30 PM - Demos & presentations to pick winners
```

## Project Tracks

Ideally your project matches one of the following project tracks. It's totally optional, you can just hack on whatever you want:

- Best Use of Toolhouse.ai platform
- Best Use of Cloudflare services
- Most likely to be a business
